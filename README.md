# The-Tech-Academy-Live-Project-Contributions

The culmination of the Tech Academy's software bootcamp was a 2 week-long live project, which allowed me the chance to work
with a small group of other students to help develop a real website.  More specifically, my particular group was assigned
to work on the Job Placement portion of The Tech Academy's website.  Here, you can view some small snippets of code which I was
responsible for writing or editing.  Just about all of my user stories revolved around front-end, and would include things like
"Turn text links into icons" or even something as simple as "Make the font on a certain view match the color of the other views."
This project gave me first-hand experience in a real developer environment.  I learned a lot about best practices and became
familiar with the overall workflow of team projects through working closely with other students, the Live Project 
Director, and classroom instructor.
